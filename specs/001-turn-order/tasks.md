# Tasks: Turn Order Generator MVP

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-turn-order/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No formal automated test suite mandated for MVP; include lightweight optional tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize minimal static project structure.

- [ ] T001 Create `public/` directory structure (public/index.html, styles.css, app.js)
- [ ] T002 Add base HTML skeleton with landmark regions in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T003 [P] Add placeholder CSS file with root variables in `public/styles.css`
- [ ] T004 [P] Initialize basic JS module pattern in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T005 Add README with quick usage instructions (root `README.md`)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities and accessibility scaffolding required by all stories.

- [ ] T006 Implement accessibility live region container in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement utility: DOM query helpers in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement Fisher-Yates shuffle function stub in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T009 Add responsive meta tag & viewport scaling in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T010 Define CSS responsive layout + spacing scale in `public/styles.css`
- [ ] T011 Add focus outline and reduced motion preferences to `public/styles.css`
- [ ] T012 Add ARIA roles and labels to structural elements in `public/index.html`

**Checkpoint**: All foundational utilities & structure present; user story work can run in parallel.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Generate Random Turn Order (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: User enters valid player count and sees random permutation.
**Independent Test**: Enter 4 -> output is permutation of 1..4; repeat generates new permutations.

### Implementation
- [ ] T013 [US1] Add player count input + label with constraints text in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Implement parse & trim input logic in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Complete Fisher-Yates shuffle implementation in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T016 [US1] Render permutation list region in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T017 [US1] Connect Generate button handler to shuffle & render in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Add randomness sanity check dev function (1000 iterations N=5 console stats) in `public/app.js`

### Optional Tests
- [ ] T019 [P] [US1] Script to run randomness frequency distribution in `tests/randomness/check.js` (optional)

**Checkpoint**: Generation works, permutation displays correctly.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Input Validation & Guidance (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Invalid inputs produce accessible, immediate feedback; generation blocked until valid.
**Independent Test**: Invalid entries show errors (1, 25, blank, abc) and no order produced.

### Implementation
- [ ] T020 [US2] Add validation rules (range 2â€“20, integer) in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Display inline error message region tied to input in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Implement live validation on input event in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T023 [US2] Disable Generate button when invalid in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T024 [US2] Announce errors via aria-live region in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Trim and sanitize pasted values before validation in `public/app.js`

### Optional Tests
- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Validation scenario script (manually invoke validation with test values) in `tests/validation/validate.js`

**Checkpoint**: Validation UX complete and accessible.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Share & Re-Generate Convenience (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: User can copy order and regenerate without re-entering count.
**Independent Test**: Copy places order in clipboard; regenerate produces different permutation.

### Implementation
- [ ] T027 [US3] Add Copy button & icon (aria-label) in `public/index.html`
- [ ] T028 [P] [US3] Implement copy-to-clipboard logic with fallback in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T029 [US3] Announce copy success via aria-live in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T030 [P] [US3] Maintain last valid count in memory variable in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T031 [US3] Ensure Generate button reuses existing valid count value in `public/app.js`

### Optional Tests
- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Manual test checklist doc `tests/manual/share-copy.md`

**Checkpoint**: Convenience features operational.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting

**Purpose**: Final quality, performance, accessibility refinements.

- [ ] T033 Add keyboard focus management (focus result heading) in `public/app.js`
- [ ] T034 [P] Add high-contrast theme verification adjustments in `public/styles.css`
- [ ] T035 [P] Minify CSS & JS (manual simple whitespace removal) optional in `public/` files
- [ ] T036 Add README usage GIF placeholder in `README.md`
- [ ] T037 Add license file `LICENSE` (select permissive, e.g., MIT)
- [ ] T038 [P] Manual mobile viewport verification notes in `tests/manual/mobile.md`
- [ ] T039 [P] Add accessibility audit notes (axe results) in `tests/accessibility/audit.md`
- [ ] T040 Final pass: ensure no external network requests (inspect code) in `public/app.js`

## Dependency Graph (User Story Level)
- US1 â†’ (independent)
- US2 â†’ depends on foundational + US1 input field (but can begin after T013/T014 are in place)
- US3 â†’ depends on US1 (needs generated order) but not on US2 strict validation (can proceed in parallel after basic generation)

## Parallel Execution Examples
- After foundational (T006â€“T012): T014, T015, T016, T018 can run in parallel.
- Validation tasks T021, T022, T025 can run in parallel once T020 stub exists.
- Copy features T028, T030 can run in parallel with T029 after button markup (T027).

## Implementation Strategy
1. Deliver MVP with Phase 1â€“3 (US1) to provide immediate user value.
2. Layer validation (Phase 4) for robustness.
3. Add convenience (Phase 5) to enhance UX.
4. Polish for accessibility & performance (Phase 6).

## Task Counts
- Total Tasks: 40
- Setup: 5
- Foundational: 7
- US1: 6 (+1 optional test) = 7
- US2: 6 (+1 optional test) = 7
- US3: 5 (+1 optional test) = 6
- Polish: 8

## MVP Scope Recommendation
Implement through T018 (end of US1) for first deploy. Remaining phases iterate without breaking core flow.

## Format Validation
All tasks comply with required pattern: `- [ ] T### [P]? [USn]? Description with file path`.
