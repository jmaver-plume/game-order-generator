# Contracts Directory

No network or external API contracts are required for this static MVP. All logic runs client-side.

## Rationale
The feature specification defines purely local transformations (number â†’ permutation). Introducing HTTP or other interfaces would violate the Static-First principle without adding user value.

If future enhancements add a backend (e.g., saving named players, sharing sessions), OpenAPI specifications will be added here.
