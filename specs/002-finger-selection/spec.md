# Feature Specification: Multi-Touch Finger Selection

**Feature Branch**: `002-finger-selection`  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add feature for users to put fingers on the screen and then the web app will randomly pick one of the fingers as the first person"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Random Finger Selection (Priority: P1)

A group of players wants to fairly determine who goes first in a game. Each player places one finger on the screen, and the app randomly selects one finger to identify the starting player.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature - random selection from multiple touch points. It delivers immediate value and can stand alone as a complete feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having 2-6 players place fingers on screen simultaneously, triggering selection, and verifying one finger is randomly highlighted as the winner. Delivers the complete value proposition of fair random selection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 3 players each place a finger on the screen, **When** they trigger the selection, **Then** the app randomly highlights exactly one finger as the winner
2. **Given** multiple rounds are played with the same finger positions, **When** selection is triggered each time, **Then** different fingers are chosen across rounds (demonstrating randomness)
3. **Given** only 1 finger is placed on screen, **When** selection is triggered, **Then** that single finger is automatically selected as the winner
4. **Given** 10 fingers are placed on screen, **When** selection is triggered, **Then** one finger is randomly selected from all 10

### User Story 2 - Visual Feedback During Selection (Priority: P2)

Players want to see an engaging animation or visual effect during the selection process to build anticipation and clearly show which finger was chosen.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience and makes the selection process more engaging, but the feature works without it (P1 already delivers core value).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering selection and observing visual feedback (animation, highlighting, sound) that clearly indicates the selection process and result. Delivers enhanced engagement value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** fingers are placed on screen, **When** selection is triggered, **Then** a visual animation plays before revealing the winner
2. **Given** a finger is selected as winner, **When** the selection completes, **Then** the winning finger is clearly highlighted with distinct visual styling
3. **Given** selection animation is playing, **When** the animation completes, **Then** the visual feedback persists until user resets for next round

### User Story 3 - Touch Point Registration and Validation (Priority: P1)

Users need immediate feedback when placing fingers on the screen to confirm their touch is registered and ready for selection.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability - users must know their touch was detected. Without this, the feature is unusable in practice. Tied with P1 as core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by placing and removing fingers while observing visual indicators (circles, dots, numbered markers) that appear/disappear with each touch. Delivers essential usability feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no fingers on screen, **When** a user places their finger down, **Then** a visual marker immediately appears at the touch location
2. **Given** 3 fingers already on screen, **When** a 4th user places their finger, **Then** a new marker appears for the 4th finger
3. **Given** 5 fingers on screen, **When** one user lifts their finger, **Then** that finger's marker immediately disappears
4. **Given** fingers are placed on screen, **When** a finger moves/slides while maintaining contact, **Then** the marker position updates in real-time

### User Story 4 - Reset and Replay (Priority: P2)

After a winner is selected, users want to easily reset the screen and start a new selection round without refreshing the page.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience for multiple rounds but not essential for first use. Users can refresh page as workaround.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a selection, using reset function, and verifying all markers are cleared and app is ready for new touches. Delivers convenience for repeated use.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a winner has been selected, **When** user triggers reset, **Then** all finger markers are cleared and app returns to ready state
2. **Given** selection animation is in progress, **When** user triggers reset, **Then** animation stops and all markers are cleared
3. **Given** app is in ready state after reset, **When** users place fingers again, **Then** new markers appear and selection can be triggered again

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user lifts their finger after selection is triggered but before animation completes?
- How does the system handle touches near the edges or corners of the screen?
- What happens if all fingers are lifted before selection is triggered?
- How does the app distinguish between intentional finger touches and accidental palm/hand touches?
- What happens if device doesn't support multi-touch (e.g., desktop with mouse)?
- What is the maximum number of simultaneous touches the app should support?
- How does the app handle rapid finger placement/removal (touch jitter)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect multiple simultaneous touch points on the screen (multi-touch support)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a visual marker at each detected touch location
- **FR-003**: System MUST track each touch point from initial contact through lift-off
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a mechanism to trigger random selection (e.g., button, gesture, timer)
- **FR-005**: System MUST randomly select exactly one touch point from all currently active touches when selection is triggered
- **FR-006**: System MUST use cryptographically secure randomization or equivalent to ensure fair selection
- **FR-007**: System MUST visually highlight the selected touch point to clearly indicate the winner
- **FR-008**: System MUST support minimum of 2 simultaneous touches and a maximum of 6 simultaneous touches (defined to balance typical device capability and group size)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when touch points are detected (immediate response)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle touch point removal (finger lift) and update display accordingly
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to reset the selection and start a new round
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent selection when fewer than 2 touches are active
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain touch point markers at fixed positions even if finger slides slightly during contact

### Key Entities

- **Touch Point**: Represents a single finger contact on screen; includes position coordinates (x, y), unique identifier for tracking, timestamp of initial contact, and state (active, selected, removed)
- **Selection Round**: Represents one complete cycle from initial touch detection through winner selection; includes collection of active touch points, selected winner, timestamp, and round state (collecting touches, selecting, complete)

## Assumptions & Dependencies

**Assumptions**:
- Users are physically co-located around a single touch-enabled device.
- Device and browser support multi-touch events (standard modern mobile/tablet browsers).
- Only one selection (first player) is needed per round; no ranking beyond first.
- Users will refrain from placing non-finger objects/palms to game the system.
- Network connectivity is not required for core functionality (local-only interaction).

**Dependencies**:
- Hardware: Touchscreen capable of detecting at least 6 distinct touch points.
- Browser: Support for standard pointer/touch event APIs.
- Fairness metric relies on unbiased random source available in runtime environment.

**Out of Scope**:
- Persisting historical selection rounds.
- Identifying individual players beyond finger presence.
- Handling more than 6 simultaneous touches.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully place fingers and trigger selection within 5 seconds of opening the app (95% success rate)
- **SC-002**: Touch points are detected and visually indicated within 100 milliseconds of finger contact
- **SC-003**: Selection process completes within 3 seconds from trigger to winner display
- **SC-004**: System accurately handles 2-10 simultaneous touches without missing or merging touch points
- **SC-005**: Random selection demonstrates statistical fairness across 100 trials (each position selected between 5-15 times for 10 positions, chi-square test p>0.05)
- **SC-006**: 90% of users successfully complete their first selection without assistance or confusion
- **SC-007**: App remains responsive and performs selection within time limits across different device types (mobile phones, tablets)
