# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Touch Finger Selection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items validated as complete on 2025-10-26. Ready for next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

Additional integration requirement (cross-feature): App must support BOTH existing numeric turn-order input flow (user enters number of players, system returns randomized order) AND new multi-touch finger selection. A clear toggle (button or switch) must allow users to switch modes without page reload. Default mode assumption: numeric input flow; users can opt into finger selection. Spec updated with FR-014, FR-015, new user story, and success criterion SC-008 to reflect this.
